To run the project:

3) Run the CS 9093 - Project.jar in the dist folder.

4) The  ‘Voice Extraction” window will pop up:

    - Use “Browser” button to choose the folder containing voice samples.

    - Enter the phrase into the text field to convert to voice.

    - Click Run and wait.

    - Based on the size of voice samples and the length of the phrase, it may take a  while for the program to finish.

    - In our test run, we tried a voice sample of 3 minutes and it took around 1-2 minutes for the program to finish. We tried your sample and it took around around 20 minutes with a powerful machine.

5) The result file will be created in the same folder of voice samples and its name will follow the format: “resullt_MM-DD-YYYY_HH-mm.wav”
